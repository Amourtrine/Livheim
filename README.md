## **Making a Valheim Worth Fighting For**
#### Change the world around you as you progress through the Forsaken. As each is defeated, your world becomes more diverse and alive while strictly sticking to Norse mythology the entire way. Progressively adds 50+ creature variations, 10+ new endgame Hunter creatures, several new bosses based on real Norse beings, and a host of lore-friendly NPC species that move in and settle in Valheim as you tame it!

## Introduction
Welcome to Livheim; an ongoing project with the goal of having the player shape the world around them. Planned within this mod are multiple progressive enemies, hunters, and bosses, as well as new intelligent beings like Elves, Orcs, Dwarves, and even fellow Vikings that move into villages and structures as you tame the world around them. Ever feel that Epic Loot's adventure mode doesn't have dangerous bounties or bounties that require long travel? Livheim also hooks into Epic Loot's trader bounty system, adding several new bosses as bounties with the stakes being higher than ever before. Start bounties on anything from the lowest little Neckling to Surtr the Fire Giant and his army of Surtlings. Want those large-scale battles, but in the comfort of your own cabin? Livheim's monsters also have multiple custom raids! Playing alone with this mod no longer feels empty or lonesome when part of your goal is making sure others survive in this land too. Help them out enough, and they may just be willing to follow you into battle...

## Installation
### Manual Installation:
1. Download dependencies and install them FIRST. Follow their individual installation process.
2. Download Livheim from above link or wherever else I've posted it.
3. Unzip the Livheim folder. Inside you'll find a 'config' and 'plugins' folder, among other things. All you need are these two folders.
4. Open the BepInEx folder in your Valheim game directory. If on steam, you can browse its local files by right clicking on it in your steam library. If you're in the right folder, you should see something like this:
![BepInExFolderExample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107686104/174546408-4e93fc43-5f92-442e-b463-b6711e0868c9.JPG)
5. Drag and drop the 'config' and 'plugins' folder from the Livheim zipped folder into your BepInEx directory. It should automatically fall into the two similar folders already there. **You MUST replace any files it asks to replace. If it doesn't ask, you didn't do it right.** Livheim has to replace a couple of files from the dependency mods you downloaded above to fully work.
6. That should be it. Run your Valheim and play your game. If you notice that none of the monsters are spawning, you may have installed something incorrectly or put something in the wrong spot.

### Automatic Installation:
- Livheim has no current way of installing automatically, although it is planned once the mod is fully running. For the closed Alpha and well into the Beta, Livheim will likely be a manual installation.
