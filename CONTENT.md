## Progressive Enemies
**Livheim features progressive enemies that, like the base game enemies, begin spawning as you defeat each Forsaken. Below details each custom monster and the boss that starts their spawning.**

### Defeated Boss: None
1. **Neckling:** A smaller, yet equally as feisty, version of the Neck that makes a good pet if you can manage to trap them without accidentally killing them. They spawn along forested streams in the Meadows, Black Forest, Swamp, and Plains. While completely harmless on their own, they can prove to be a bit much to handle during a 'Storm Swarm'. Storm Swarms are something that naturally happen during a storm. The extreme rain drives the different Necks from their streams and further inland, causing a small 'swarm' of neck across the wet landscape.
2. **Trapped Soul:** As part of my goal to fill the Mist Lands with creatures, the Trapped Soul forms an important part of that. The Trapped Soul is exactly as named, a soul trapped within the Mist Lands, a land that I personally believe is a reference to the 9th realm of [Helheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hel_(location)). Unfortunate souls, ferried to Hel because of their unremarkable deaths of old age or sickness, become trapped in its unless maze of mist and twisted roots. They have no goal and no drive, no reason to harm the player. Killing them would be an act of mercy, releasing their soul from the grips of Helheim. The only problem is, like many other creatures now found in the Mist Lands, they can **only** take spirit damage.

### Defeated Boss: Eikthyr
1. **Brute Boar:** A larger and meaner version of the regular boar. Usually found alone because of their aggressive nature, Brute Boars are often easy to deal with by the time they start spawning. They can be found in forested areas within the Meadows and Black Forest. Aside from an increased attack damage and damage resistance, the Brute Boar behaves like a typical boar.
2. **Elder Boar:** A small and elderly boar, able to live to his age because of your efforts to quell the chaos in the Meadows. They can typically be found shuffling about in the berry bushes of the Meadows and only the Meadows. Easily spotted by their greyed hair, an Elder Boar will run at the first sight of danger, their old body unable to battle like it used to. Its advised to leave them alone, as their meat is tough and stringy in their age anyway.
3. **Alpha Neck:** As the dust settles around Eikthyr's demise, the forest creatures often find themselves without a guide. The Necks are one such example that stepped up to the occasion. Alpha Necks are a larger version of the typical Neck with increased damage and resistance to poison. They can often be found around their peers, leading the group to food or away from danger.
